# InvertProject 

**InvertProject** contains all MATLAB source files, build scripts, and generated CUDA/ROS 2 artifacts used to create and deploy the standalone **`invertCameraRos2`** node on an NVIDIA Jetson device.

This project extends the workflow from the earlier **GrayCameraRos2** example, replacing the grayscale CUDA processing library (`gpuGrayscale`) with a custom image inversion library (`gpuInvert`).
