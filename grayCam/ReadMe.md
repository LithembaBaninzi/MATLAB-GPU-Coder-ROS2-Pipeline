## Gray Camera ROS2 Package - MATLAB to Jetson Deployment Files

### Iterative Development Cycle
1. Modify grayCameraRos2.m on the host PC
2. Run buildJetsonGray.m to generate a new package
3. Transfer the new .tgz to Jetson
4. Rebuild on Jetson
5. Test and verify

 ## File Reference Details
 1. **grayCameraRos2.m - Main Node**
    - Input: Camera feed
    - Processing: CUDA-accelerated grayscale conversion
    - Output: ROS2 topic /camera/image_gray
    - Dependencies: ROS2, CUDA, GStreamer
      
 2. **ros2GraySub.m - Visualization Client**
    - Connects to Jetson ROS2 network
    - Subscribes to the grayscale image topic
    - Displays real-time video feed in MATLAB
    - Useful for debugging and verification
 
 3. **CMakeLists_Updated.txt - Critical Changes**
    - Fixed GStreamer package detection
    - Removed problematic MATLAB library import
    - Cleaned compile options
    - Added proper library directories
